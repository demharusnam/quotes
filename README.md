## About
This project is the solution to [Wise Publishing Back End Developer Challenge 2020]{https://bitbucket.org/2576250inc/back-end-developer-challenge-1/src/master/}.


## First Task
The website created features a registration system in which users can create their account to login and store their quotes alongside the name of their favourite show, season, episode, and the bonus criteria of a random image accessed via [https://picsum.photos/](https://picsum.photos/) API. Furthermore, it features a landing, registration, login, create, and quotes pages. All information is stored on your local server.

## Second Task
The custom artisan command can be run as follows within the root directory of project: `php artisan AvgPPS`

Usage and description can be found via `php artisan help AvgPPS`

NOTE: ap_copi.sql must be registered in your local database first, as the information is all processed directly from the table. As per the requirements, queries are completed one per state with a one to many relationship.
